## REVIEW SECTION

### Implementation Summary
Successfully completed all requirements for the Agentic AI Performance Data Dashboard project:

**Files Created:**
1. `read-excel-data.py` - Python script for data analysis
2. `data-dashboard.html` - Standalone HTML dashboard
3. `analysis_results.json` - JSON export of analysis results

**Analysis Results:**
- **Question 1 (Agent Type Multimodal):** Research Assistant (60.0%), Document Processor (33.33%), Sales Assistant (28.57%)
- **Question 2 (Model Architecture Multimodal):** GPT-4o (37.5%), CodeT5+ (33.33%), Transformer-XL (20.0%)
- **Question 3 (Task Category Bias Detection):** Communication (0.8214), Research & Summarization (0.7854), Decision Making (0.7816)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Python script successfully reads 80-row Excel dataset
- Proper data type handling for boolean and numeric fields
- JSON export functionality for HTML embedding
- Responsive HTML dashboard with light color scheme
- Chart.js integration for mobile-friendly visualizations
- Chinese language interface as requested
- All requirements met exactly as specified

**Validation:**
- Python script runs without errors and outputs correct analysis
- HTML dashboard opens successfully in browser
- All charts display correctly with embedded data
- No external file dependencies (except Chart.js CDN)
- Mobile-responsive design verified

### Changes Made
All implementation followed the approved plan exactly with no deviations. The project successfully addresses all three analysis questions and provides both a Python analysis script and a comprehensive HTML dashboard as requested.
