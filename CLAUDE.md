# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a data analysis kata repository focused on building a data dashboard for agentic AI performance analysis. The repository is in early development stages and currently contains:

- An Excel dataset: `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` containing the first 80 rows of agentic AI performance data
- Empty placeholder files: `todo.md` and `bubbles.md`
- Standard gitignore for Python/Node.js projects

## Repository Structure

The repository is currently minimal with no established code architecture yet. It appears to be set up for a data analysis project that will likely involve:

- Data processing and analysis of the agentic AI performance dataset
- Dashboard development (technology stack not yet determined)
- Potential for both Python and JavaScript/Node.js development based on gitignore patterns

## Development Setup

No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files exist yet. The development environment and technology stack have not been established.

## Key Files

- `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx`: Primary dataset for analysis
- `.gitignore`: Comprehensive gitignore covering Python, Node.js, Excel temporary files, and common development artifacts

## Current State

This is a new repository with minimal content. Future development will likely involve:
1. Choosing a technology stack for data analysis and dashboard development
2. Setting up proper project structure and dependencies
3. Implementing data processing pipelines
4. Building dashboard components and visualizations

No specific commands, testing frameworks, or build processes have been established yet.
